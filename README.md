In my MCA I did Coding Ninja Course for Web Tech. and In the course I had a Major project to make Homepage and single playlist page for a Online Music PLayer website but only Using HTML and CSS we can add JS in it later.
Main Homepage of the website is musicPlayer.html and styling for this html is done by using external css called musicPlayer.css and for the Playlist page we made Single Playlist Screen
using html charliePuth.html and styling css in Single Playlist Screen charliePuth.css and two other files contains music and images.
